# Basic 9


https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/basic/9/

For this challenge, we utilized Basic 8 to complete this challenge. Back on Basic 8 we submitted the following command to see Basic 9's directory structure, using the path we already know

`<!--#exec cmd=”ls /var/www/hackthissite.org/html/missions/basic/9/" -->`

Executing this command gives us the output of the directory where the flag was
located.

This was the first challenge that required us to use the attack vector of the
previous challenge to find the flag.
